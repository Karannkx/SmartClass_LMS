# ðŸ“š SmartClass_LMS
SmartClass_LMS is a full-featured Learning Management System designed for modern virtual classrooms, making learning interactive and seamless. It offers an interactive dashboard to track recent activities, a platform to share study materials and notes, tools to assign and submit tasks, real-time online classes and group discussions powered by WebRTC, a dedicated doubt resolution section, and up-to-date class schedule management. The system is built using React and SCSS for a dynamic frontend, Node.js and Express.js for a robust backend, WebRTC and Socket.io for real-time communication, and MongoDB for efficient data storage. To set it up, first clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/karannkx/SmartClass_LMS.git` and navigate to the project folder with `cd SmartClass_LMS`. For the client, enter the `client` folder, run `npm install`, and create a `.env` file containing `REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name`, `REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key`, `REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret`, `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`, and `REACT_APP_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:5000`. Then, open a new terminal for the server, navigate to the `server` folder, run `npm install` followed by `npm install jsonwebtoken multer`, and create a `.env` file with `MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_url`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret`, and `CRYPTOJS_SECRET_KEY=your_crypto_key`. To start the application, run `npm start` in both the client and server terminals. You can log in as an admin using the email `admin123@gmail.com` and password `admin@123`. The project folder structure includes a `client` directory for the React frontend with its `.env` file, a `server` directory for the Node.js backend with its `.env` file, and the `README.md` file. Youâ€™ll need Node.js, npm, a MongoDB instance (local or cloud), and a Cloudinary account to run it.
